# Car permutation
Consider the railroad switching network given in Figure 3.3. Railroad cars
numbered 1, 2, 3, :.. , n are initially in the top right track segment (in this
order, left to right). Railroad cars can be moved into the vertical track seg-
ment one at a time from either of the horizontal segments and then moved
from the vertical segment to any one of the horizontal segments. The verti-
cal segment operates as a stack as new cars enter at the top and cars depart
the vertical segment from the top. 

## posible permutations
### 1. n = 3:
- 1, 2, 3
- 1, 3, 2
- 2, 1, 3
- 2, 3, 1
- 3, 2, 1
  
### 2. n = 4:
- 1,2,3,4
- 1,2,4,3
- 1,3,2,4
- 1,3,4,2
- 1,4,3,2
- 2,1,3,4
- 2,1,4,3
- 2,3,1,4
- 2,3,4,1
- 2,4,3,1
- 3,2,1,4
- 3,2,4,1
- 3,4,2,1
- 4,3,2,1

## imposible permutations:
### 1. n = 3
- 3, 1, 2

### 2. n = 4
- 4, 1, 2, 3
- 4, 1, 3, 2
- 4, 2, 1, 3
- 4, 2, 3, 1
- 4, 3, 1, 2
- 3, 1, 2, 4
- 3, 1, 4, 2
- 3, 4, 1, 2
- 2, 4, 1, 3
- 1, 4, 2, 3
